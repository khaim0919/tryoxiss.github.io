<p>Ever wondered what all those weird messages mean? Well heres a doc article to tell you! This is more targeted at general audiances than the developers, but it will still be useful to both!!</p>
<p>So, to setup AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) keys, we need to go through a TLS (Transport Layer Security) &quot;handshake&quot;, which uses RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) keys to securely establish a shared secret. This will happen every time you connect to voice, or view a text channel for the first time in a while, or every few months if its opened reguarly! This helps keep the shared secret secret, even if there is a data leak that we don't know about--all your messages are still safe.</p>
<p><strong>ALL TIMES CURRENTLY ARE AN ESTIMATE AND NOT FIELD TESTED YET!!</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sending Encryption Request</strong> (time: ~1-10ms)</li>
<li><strong>Recieving TLS certificate</strong> (time:  ~1-10ms)</li>
<li><strong>Veryfying Certificate</strong> (time: ~2-7ms)</li>
<li><strong>Extracting Public Key</strong> (time: ~2-7ms)</li>
<li><strong>Encrypting pre-master key</strong> (time: ~2-5ms)</li>
<li><strong>Computing shared secret</strong> (time: 5-30ms)</li>
<li><strong>Sending Client Test Message</strong> (time: 1-3ms)</li>
<li><strong>Decoding Server Test Message</strong> (time: 1-3ms)</li>
<li><strong>Handshake Complete!</strong> is when the handshake is completed, it will last as long as is needed for that medium. For example, if you are in a voice call, it will last until you disconnect.</li>
</ol>
