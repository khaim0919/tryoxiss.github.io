<p>Profiles are made up of a series of objects that determine its appearnace and details. A profile is a subset of an account, and an account can have multiple profiles which can be swapped between freely.</p>
<h2>Identification</h2>
<p>An account can be identified with a GUID, which is an unchanging ID system which will <a href="http://guid.one/guid">virtually never collide</a> (1 in 3.403×10³⁸ (340,282,366,900,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (340 Decillion)) chance), so to reach the limit, all 8 billion of us on earth would need to each create 269,757,076,750 GUID's every seccond to reach the limit before the sun explodes!</p>
<p>Each account also has a few other identification values, which can change. All names follow the <code>@username#0001@example.net</code> format. We know that can be quite unweildy, so you can remove any unneeded sections! For example, if you want to ping <code>@alice#1234@example.net</code> and they are the <em>only</em> alice in the hub, you can just ping <code>@alice</code>. You only need to specify far enough to make it <em>unique for the time of sending a message</em>, after that its tracked via GUID.</p>
<p>So lets say there are two alice's in that hub, now what? Well, you can specify based on instance <em>or</em> discriminator! If one or the other is the same, you will need to use the one that is not the same, but that is a rare occurance.</p>
<p>Users also have a display name (<code>prefered_name</code>) property, which is what actually shows up when talking to them.</p>
<p>You can additionally store info on people, such as a note, thier birthday, etc. This all is stored in JSON, but can be imported or exported as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard">.vcf</a> or vCard format, which is highly standardised.</p>
